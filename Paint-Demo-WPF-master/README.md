wpfPainter
==========

A tutoring exercise in WPF for exploring general concepts in C# and XAML. 
This is a learning project and will have constant rough edges as my main skills were in VB and F#. 
WPF is fairly involved to so a drawing type application gives a lot of scope for playing with a wide variety of techniques.

Where 3rd party code has directly helped me substantially, I note credit :)

It was a playing around project that I need to remove from Github sometime!

Especially as there's a lot of nonsense code left in here from various things I was learning at the time.
